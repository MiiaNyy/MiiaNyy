## üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who I am

I found my passion for coding after I was laid off from my job as a chef in 2020. Suddenly I had all this free time and decided to fulfill my long-term dream and started to learn how to create websites. Pretty quickly I fell in love with the whole process, the problem solving, and the way how creative I could be.

Now two years later I am even more passionate and in love for coding and problem solving than before. I have a also a paper that states that I am officially a software developer üéâ

My another passions are traveling üåç and everything sci-fi üëΩ, movies, books, video games you name it.

## üé® My skills

My strongest skills are in the frontend technologies like React, HTML, CSS but, Node.js and Express are not unknown to me either. I have worked with NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Firebase Fireship on multiple projects and I have tipped my toes in Azure services. Building and using REST APIs isn't a problem for me and I am started to learn GraphQL.

My go to editor is ![WebStorm](https://img.shields.io/badge/webstorm-143?style=for-the-badge&logo=webstorm&logoColor=white&color=black)
